# Quantum Gate Library
This page is to collect and define quantum gates that are meaningful to quantum algorithms, domain applications, devices, and operations. This will serve as a standard gate set for qasmtrans and our other tools. Other definitions can be found in [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_logic_gates).
One can also find some standard gate defintion [here](https://threeplusone.com/pubs/on_gates.pdf).

## 1-qubit Gates

```

```

```

```

\end{bmatrix}
```
Quantinuum devices uses the U2 gates with two parameters $\theta$, $\psi, as one of the one-qubit basis gates. See [Quantinuum System Model H1 Product Data Sheet](https://assets.website-files.com/617730fbcf7b7c387194556a/62a8f7244596df4d854c2222_Quantinuum%20H1%20Product%20Data%20Sheet%20v5%2014JUN22.pdf).
```math
U_{1q}(\theta, \psi) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) & -\sin(\theta/2)\sin(\psi)-i\sin(\theta/2)cos(\psi) \\
\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\psi)-i\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\psi) & 0
\end{bmatrix}
```


#### ID Gate 
The ID gate leaves the state of a qubit unchanged. It is used to maintain the coherence of qubits that are not currently used or for padding in quantum circuits to align the timing of operations across different qubits. 
```math
\text{ID} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
```
Sometimes, the ID gate can take a timing parameter so that relaxation noise can be modeled.
```math
\text{ID}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
```
#### GPI Gate
The GPI gate performs a π or bit-flip rotation with an embedded phase. It always rotates π radians—hence the name—but can rotate on any longitudinal axis of the Bloch sphere. At a ϕ of 0 this is equivalent to an X gate, and at a ϕ of 0.25 turns (π/2 radians) it’s equivalent to a Y gate, but it can also be mapped to any other azimuthal angle. It is one of the one-qubit basis gates for IonQ devices. See their [doc](https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates). It is physically implemented as a Rabi oscillation made with a two-photon Raman transition, i.e. driving the qubits on resonance using a pair of lasers in a Raman configuration. See [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2).
```math
\text{GPI}(\phi) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\phi/2) - i\sin(\phi/2) & 0 \\
0 & \cos(\phi/2) + i\sin(\phi/2)
\end{bmatrix}
```

#### GPI2 Gate
The GPi2 gate could be considered an RX(π/2) — or RY(π/2) — with an embedded phase. It always rotates π/2 radians but can rotate on any longitudinal axis of the Bloch sphere. At a ϕ of π this is equivalent to RX(π/2), at a ϕ of 0.25 turns (π/2 radians) it’s equivalent to RY(π/2), but it can also be mapped to any other azimuthal angle. It is one of the one-qubit basis gates for IonQ devices. See their [doc](https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates). It is physically implemented as a Rabi oscillation made with a two-photon Raman transition, i.e. driving the qubits on resonance using a pair of lasers in a Raman configuration. See [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2).
```math
\text{GPI2}(\phi) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sin(\phi)-i\cos(\phi) \\
\sin(\phi)-i\cos(\phi) & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```
#### VZ Gate
IonQ does not expose or implement a Z gate, where it waits for the phase to advance in time, but a Virtual RZ can be performed by simply advancing or retarding the phase of the following operation in the circuit. This does not physically change the internal state of the trapped ion at the time of its implementation; it changes the phases of the future operations such that it is equivalent to an actual Z-rotation around the Bloch sphere. In effect, virtual RZ operations are implied by the phase inputs to later gates. See [doc](https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates). IBMQ uses similar strategy for their RZ basis gate (known as Virtual Z gate or VZ gate) of the superconducting devices. See detail in [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00858).
```math
\text{VZ} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sin(\phi)-i\cos(\phi) \\
\sin(\phi)-i\cos(\phi) & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```

\sin(\phi+\psi)-i\cos(\phi+\psi) & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```
