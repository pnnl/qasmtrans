# QASMTrans
QASMTrans is a quantum transpiler for effectively parsing and translating general OpenQASM[1] circuits to
circuits compiled for a particular NISQ device (e.g., from IBMQ, Rigetti, IonQ, Quantinuum), addressing
the contraints of basis gates and qubit topology. QASMTrans is purely developed in C++ without external
library dependency, facilitate deployment across platforms. It is specially designed for emerging deep
circuits, such as those from HHL, QPE, quantum simulation, etc. QASMTrans is easy to extend for adding 
new optimization passes and backend devices (see [extension](passes/README.md)). For some examplar 
QASM circuits, please check our [QASMBench](https://github.com/pnnl/qasmbench).

Please check our paper for details and performance: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07581.pdf


## Installation
To install the software, follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/qasmtrans.git
cd qasmtrans
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```

## Execution
To run the transpiler, use the command below:

```bash
./qasmtrans -i ../data/test_benchmark/bv10.qasm -m ibmq -c ../data/devices/ibmq_toronto.json -v 1
```

## Correctness verification
We also test our QASMTrans correctness, we use the same simulator from qiskit to test our transpiled qasm file and qiskit own transpiled file, we pass the file when the differences is less than 0.5%, to run the test simply run the command below:

```bash
cd test
sh validation_test.sh
```

All the detailed result will be stored in compare_summary
## Options
QASMTrans command-line options:

- `-i`: Input qasm file, e.g.  `data/test_benchmark/bv10.qasm`    

- `-o`: Specify the output file location, the default path is `data/output_qasm_file/{circuit}_{mode}.qasm`.

- `-b`: Sepcify basis gate set {x, y, z} (Future support) 

- `-q`: Take a qasm circuit string as input (Future support)

- `-m`: Set the mode that determines the specific basis gate set for a vendor:
  - `ibmq` : The basis gates for IBMQ here is [rz,sx,x,cx] (default)
  - `ionq`:  The basis gates for IonQ here is [rx(gpi),ry(gpi2),rz(gz),rxx(ms)] 
  - `quantinuum` : The basis gates for Quantinuum here is [U(&#03b8;,&#03d5;),rz,zz]
  - `rigetti` : The basis gates for Rigetti here is [rx,ry,cz] 

- `-c`: Specify the backend device with certain topology. The path is "data/devices/"

    IBMQ Machines (Heavy-hexagon):
    
    - `ibmq_toronto (27 qubits)` (default option)
    - `ibmq_jakarta (7 qubits)`
    - `ibmq_guadalupe (16 qubits)`
    - `ibm_cairo (27 qubits)`
    - `ibm_brisbane (127 qubits)`

    Rigetti Machine (Ring):
    - `aspen_m3 (80 qubits)`

    Quantinuum Machine (All-to-all connected):
    - `h1_2 (12 qubits)`
    - `h1_1 (20 qubits)` 
    
    Dummy Machines (All-to-all connected):
    
    - `dummy_ibmq12 (12 qubits)`
    - `dummy_ibmq14 (14 qubits)`
    - `dummy_ibmq15 (15 qubits)`
    - `dummy_ibmq16 (16 qubits)`
    - `dummy_ibmq30 (30 qubits)` 

- `-limited`: Limit the number of qubits used (i.e., avoid using all physical qubits of the device). Due to more limited topology, more gates can be introduced. This option is
particularly useful for numerical simulation on a classical system, given less qubits.

- `-v`: Set the verbose level for debugging:
  - 0 : No output (default)
  - 1 : Output device_name, gate_ops, transpilation time, output file location
  - 2 : Detailed information, including initial_mapping, transpilation time for different steps during the routing/mapping pass

## Data Structure
The central data structure are:

`Circuit`: each transpilation pass takes in a circuit object and applies the logic of the pass to the circuit:
- `n_qubits`: The total number of qubits in the circuit.
- `gates`: A vector storing the gates (or quantum operations) applied within the circuit.

`Gate`: basic data structure for a gate:
- `op_name`: This attribute specifies the type of gate. Examples include 'CX' (CNOT gate), 'Rz' (Pauli-Z rotation gate), etc.
- `ctrl`: This defines the control qubit for controlled operations.
- `qubit`: This represents the target qubit upon which the gate operation is applied.
- `theta/lambda/phi/gama`: These are parameters representing the rotation angle (where applicable) for the gate operation.

## External Files:
QASMTrans includes two external source header files:
- [lexer.hpp](https://github.com/ArashPartow/lexertk): Lexertk, a simple to use, easy to integrate and extremely fast lexicographical generator.
- [json.hpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/json): a C++ json operation library.
